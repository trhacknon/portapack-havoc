HAVOC is a fork of the PortaPack H1 firmware, a portability add-on for the [HackRF One software-defined radio](http://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/).

Hardware is available at [ShareBrained Technology](http://sharebrained.com/portapack).

It is build on top of [ShareBrained's firmware](https://github.com/trhacknon/portapack-hackrf/).

# Summary

As its name implies, HAVOC's functions can be fun, mean or even useful sometimes. You probably shouldn't use them. No ! Bad ! Put it down.

**In most countries, radio transmissions are tightly regulated. Transmitting outside of free/public bands without a licence or authorization, even at very low power, is certainly forbidden where you live. Always bear that in mind. You're the ONLY ONE responsible for what you do with this software.**

# Progress

Feature | Progress | Notes
------- | -------- | -----
POCSAG RX   | 95% | Needs support for numeric messages
Morse TX    | 95% | Needs fox hunt scheduler and live keying mode
Mic. TX     | 95% | Carrier leak bug, need to find guard tones for various brands of wireless mics
ADS-B RX    | 90% | Needs angle and speed decoding
Close-Callâ„¢ | 85% | Needs adjustments and optimization for wider frequency range
ADS-B TX    | 85% | Works but baseband module needs cleaning
SSTV TX     | 80% | Needs better bitmap file handling, support for other modes (ROBOT ?) and callsign FSK ID
Radiosondes | 75% | Needs support for other models
Wave visualizer | 70% | Needs cleaning and handling of other sample formats, high priority
AFSK RX     | 70% | Needs work regarding flexibility
Sigfox RX   | 40% | Tuning basics done, needs decoding code and testing
Generic TXs | 30% | Raw AX.25, AFSK, FSK, CCIR, DTMF... Tonesets are ready
CC1101 TRX  | 10% | And other sub-GHz transceiver chips like SI4032...
SSTV RX     | 0%  | 
Scanner     | 0%  | Easy, could be used with POCSAG RX to catch jumping channels
SSB TX      | 0%  | Requested but math is hard :(
OOK RX      | 0%  | See if rtl_433's author is fine with using protocol defs
Analog TV TX| 0%  | Enough CPU ? B&W and no sound ?
LoJack RX   | 0%  | Basically AFSK RX
DMR info RX | 0%  | Retrieve DMR channel info. **No voice** because of vocoder complexity and possible legal issue
Tetra info? | 0%  | Same
